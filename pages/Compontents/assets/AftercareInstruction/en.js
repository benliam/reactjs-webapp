       <h3>Tips</h3>
       <p> In the 3 days after the tattoo is finished, you must not put all kinds of chemicals and cosmetics (soap, shampoo, shower gel, perfume ...) into the tattoo.

       <p>After the tattoo is completed, do not arbitrarily apply the ointment (eg, ointment examines Tetraciline, Clocid - H ... ..) on the tattoo so that the color of the tattoo will be affected.</p>

       <h3>Avoid strong activities</h3>
       <p>After the tattoo is completed, you should work quietly, avoid strong activities and sports such as soccer, bodybuilding .... (It is best to rest for at least 10 to 25 days for such strong activities) so that the tattoo does not crack during healing.</p>

       <h4>Mindful</h4>
       <p>In 3 days after the tattoo is completed, the tattoo will be scabbed (thick or thin scales will depend on the phenotype and location of each person). When flaking off, you will feel itchy because the tattoo is on the skin, but remember not to peel, do not scratch and do not worry about seeing your tattoo during the peeling process seems fuzzy and wrinkled. You can gently massage or let things happen naturally without any impact on it, after the scales are naturally peeled off until the tattoo has creased, your skin is stretched back to normal. The color of the tattoo will be standardized (Note: the duration of this process will last from 20 to 30 days, which may take longer depending on the location of each person).</p>
